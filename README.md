# YoutubeCloneBasic

This is a basic version of YoutubeClone designed using ReactJS and many other components present in it, It is just a naive Youtube Clone with limited features but the website is designed in such a way that it is fully responsive and scalable.

The dependencies installed during the project are specified in the *package.json* folder.

The Youtube Clone has several Components SearchBar,VideoDetails,VideoList etc where in each component has got its own resposibility which is clear by its naming and there is a heavy passing of props to and fro to different components and retreiving the information back into the same state.

**The main thing here is to make an account in Youtube API from where you can get the tokens and authentication to fetch the related video and its contents like title,subtitle,thumbnails.** 

Rest the code is very simple and human readable...
